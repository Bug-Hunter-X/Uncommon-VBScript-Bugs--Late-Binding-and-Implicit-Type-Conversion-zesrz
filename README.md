# Uncommon VBScript Bugs

This repository demonstrates two less common but potentially problematic areas in VBScript programming: late binding and implicit type conversion.  The examples highlight how these can lead to unexpected runtime errors and data corruption, and offer solutions to mitigate these issues.

## Bugs:

* **Late Binding:**  VBScript's late binding, while convenient, can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to debug.  Errors may occur only when a specific object isn't available, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.
* **Implicit Type Conversion:**  The loose typing in VBScript can cause problems when implicit type conversions result in unexpected data truncation or inaccurate calculations.

## Solutions:

The solutions provided focus on using early binding to ensure object availability and explicit type conversion to manage data consistency.
